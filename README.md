# .biff
This is the repository for my image file format called "**.biff**".

## Description
This repository includes the .png to .biff converter and the image viewer.

All of the code in this project is written in rust.

This is my first rust project so please be kind.

I was inspired to make this because of [this](https://youtu.be/48B8FPmMT0g) video by FaceDev
